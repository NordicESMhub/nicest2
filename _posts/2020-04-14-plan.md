# Background and connections

## Background

Earth System Modeling research is essential to assess the drastic impacts of climate change and 
requires huge computing and storage resources that are still provided locally e.g. at national level.
This hinders bit-replicability and makes it difficult for researchers to compare their developments and confidently validate the scientific results. 
In addition, the cost and expertise necessary for developing and improving Earth System Models often lead researchers to join large international consortium that do not necessarily focus on the Nordic regions.
Most Nordic countries participate to initiatives such as [CMIP6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) and/or [CORDEX](https://cordex.org/) (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) but in a very little coordinated way.

The EuroHPC initiative is a unique opportunity for the Nordic countries towards a coordinated effort for the Nordic participation to Climate Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP) provided that all the necessary building blocks (containerization, workflow management, job orchestration,
model diagnostics) for creating fully reproducible and efficient ESM workflows as well as for publishing FAIR climate data are in place.

## Connections with other organisations or projects

### Earth system modeling and CMIP
An important way to get ESMs internationally recognized is through the World Climate
Research Program (WCRP) sponsored CMIPs which is a unique international initiative that
highlights the importance of sharing, comparing and analyzing the outcomes of global
climate model simulations and to deliver high quality climate information. CMIP results have
been used in a very large number of scientific studies that make them a cornerstone of IPCC
assessment reports. Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish modeling groups have
committed to participate in phase 6 of CMIP (CMIP6).
The regional counterpart to CMIP is the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment
(CORDEX) endorsed by the WCRP that has produced a large ensemble of RCM
integrations at high horizontal resolution for all continents. The CORDEX results are now
being used worldwide for climate impact studies and climate change adaptation work.

### ENES and IS-ENES: The European Network for Earth System modeling
Several partners in this proposal are actively involved in the ENES/IS-ENES European
collaboration. ENES aims to i) help in the development and evaluation of state-of-the-art
climate and ESMs, ii) facilitate focused model intercomparisons in order to assess and
improve them, iii) encourage exchanges of software and model results, iv) help in the
development of high-performance computing facilities dedicated to long high-resolution,
multi-model ensemble integrations.
The Climate Modelling community is an essential component of joint European efforts to
build a European framework of earth system modelling as part of the ENES/IS-ENES
network (European Network for Earth System Science), through Horizon 2020 projects (e.g.
CRESCENDO), as well as Joint Programming Initiative and possibly European Strategy
Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) instruments. 

### Infrastructure for Norwegian Earth System modelling (INES)
Norwegian partners of the NICEST-2 proposal are all engaged in the INES project (funded
by the Norwegian Research Council) that aims at establishing the next generation climate
model for Norwegian and Nordic research and at providing society and business with the
most recent high-quality knowledge base, at a time when climate change is understood and recognized as a primary driver for change in wide socio-economic areas of Norway. The
INES project is unique in Norway, serving climate-related user communities in a costefficient way, which will further enhance knowledge transfer to all researchers in the Nordics.

### The Nordics and NeIC

Improving the scientific accuracy of the ESMs requires huge computing and storage
resources that are still provided locally, at national level. This hinders bit-replicability and
makes it difficult for researchers to compare their developments and confidently validate the
scientific results. While this research is essential to assess the drastic impacts of climate
change in the Nordics, Nordic countries cannot expect this research to be carried out by
other international teams who obviously focus on their own regional issues.
Within the Nordic ESM modeling community, there is significant and sustained support for
the concept of a Nordic collaboration. Several initiatives have been initiated in response to
this ongoing interest.

#### NICEST

The objective of the NICEST project is to strengthen the Nordic ESM community by
supporting the efficient use of various e-infrastructures through competence building, sharing
and exchanging knowledge. The project ended in december 2019.

#### NordicESM

The NordForsk NordicESM project investigated the potential modes and merits
of a coordinated/integrated Nordic platform and collaboration for earth system modeling.

#### EOSC-Nordic

European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Nordic aims at bridging e-services in the Nordic
region with European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The Nordic Climate Community is
represented in EOSC-Nordic by a few partners of the NICEST project. NICEST-2
complements this unique climate science demonstrator by ensuring that i) the EOSC-Nordic
services are fully adopted by the Nordic community, ii) relevant training material is
developed and introduced to researchers from different disciplines, iii) other use cases can
also be easily deployed on EOSC-Nordic services following the same approach. 


## Success factors

# Objective
## Project idea

Towards Open Science, reproducibility of earth system runs is as important as producing
accurate and Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) climate data. The
EuroHPC initiative is a unique opportunity for the Nordic countries towards a joint Climate
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) participation provided that all the necessary building
blocks (containerization, workflow management, job orchestration, model diagnostics) for
creating fully reproducible and efficient Earth System Model (ESM) workflows as well as for
publishing FAIR climate data are in place.

## Project objective

NICEST-2 aims at i) improving the e-infrastructure to tackle these challenges in optimal
conditions, with minimal waste of resources, and ii) setting up the building blocks for ESM
workflows which are to be deployed as part of the Nordic European Open Science Cloud
(EOSC), thereby realizing its full potential for the benefit of the Nordics.
