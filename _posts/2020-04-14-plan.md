# Background and connections

## Background

Earth System Modeling research is essential to assess the drastic impacts of climate change and 
requires huge computing and storage resources that are still provided locally e.g. at national level.
This hinders bit-replicability and makes it difficult for researchers to compare their developments and confidently validate the scientific results. 
In addition, the cost and expertise necessary for developing and improving Earth System Models often lead researchers to join large international consortium that do not necessarily focus on the Nordic regions.
Most Nordic countries participate to initiatives such as [CMIP6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) and/or [CORDEX](https://cordex.org/) (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) but in a very little coordinated way.

The [EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/) initiative is a unique opportunity for the Nordic countries towards a coordinated effort for the Nordic participation to Climate Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP) provided that all the necessary building blocks (containerization, workflow management, job orchestration,
model diagnostics) for creating fully reproducible and efficient ESM workflows as well as for publishing FAIR climate data are in place.

### Expected benefits

- More ESM simulations done in less time through performance enhancements of the codes and optimization of the workflows for the entire community
- Homogeneous workflows for ESMs (NorESM, EC-Earth)
- Common diagnostic tools/workflows for highlighting climate impact in the Nordics
- Lower cost and better energy efficiency of the simulations
- Possibility to have a joint Nordic CMIP participation
- Benefit for all ESM researchers in the Nordic, not only those involved in CMIPs
- Climate data would be easier to access and exploit, even for non-specialists


## Connections with other organisations or projects

### Earth system modeling and CMIP

An important way to get ESMs internationally recognized is through the [World Climate
Research Program](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/) (WCRP) sponsored CMIPs which is a unique international initiative that
highlights the importance of sharing, comparing and analyzing the outcomes of global
climate model simulations and to deliver high quality climate information. [CMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip) results have
been used in a very large number of scientific studies that make them a cornerstone of [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/)
assessment reports. Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish modeling groups have
participated in phase 6 of CMIP (CMIP6).
The regional counterpart to CMIP is the [Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment](https://cordex.org/)
(CORDEX) endorsed by the WCRP that has produced a large ensemble of RCM
integrations at high horizontal resolution for all continents. The CORDEX results are now
being used worldwide for climate impact studies and climate change adaptation work.

### ENES and IS-ENES: The European Network for Earth System modeling

Several partners in this proposal are actively involved in the [ENES/IS-ENES](https://is.enes.org/) European
collaboration. ENES aims to 

- help in the development and evaluation of state-of-the-art climate and ESMs, 
- facilitate focused model intercomparisons in order to assess and improve them, 
- encourage exchanges of software and model results, iv) help in the development of high-performance computing facilities dedicated to long high-resolution, multi-model ensemble integrations.

The Climate Modelling community is an essential component of joint European efforts to
build a European framework of earth system modelling as part of the ENES/IS-ENES
network (European Network for Earth System Science), through Horizon 2020 projects (e.g.
[CRESCENDO](https://www.crescendoproject.eu/)), as well as Joint Programming Initiative and possibly 
[European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures](https://www.esfri.eu/) (ESFRI) instruments. 

### Infrastructure for Norwegian Earth System modelling (INES)

Norwegian partners of the NICEST-2 proposal are all engaged in the 
[Infrastructure for Norwegian Earth System modelling](https://noresmhub.github.io/INES/) (INES) project 
(funded by the Norwegian Research Council) that aims at establishing the next generation climate
model for Norwegian and Nordic research and at providing society and business with the
most recent high-quality knowledge base, at a time when climate change is understood and recognized as a primary driver for change in wide socio-economic areas of Norway.
The INES project is unique in Norway, serving climate-related user communities in a cost-efficient way, which will further enhance knowledge transfer to all researchers in the Nordics.

### The Nordics and NeIC

Within the Nordic ESM modeling community, there is significant and sustained support for
the concept of a Nordic collaboration. Several initiatives have been initiated in response to
this ongoing interest.

#### NordicESM

The NordForsk [NordicESM](https://nordicesm.bitbucket.io/) project investigated the potential modes and merits
of a coordinated/integrated Nordic platform and collaboration for earth system modeling. The project ended in November 2017.

#### NICEST

The objective of the [NICEST](https://neic.no/nicest/) project was to strengthen the Nordic ESM community by
supporting the efficient use of various e-infrastructures through competence building, sharing
and exchanging knowledge. The project ended in december 2019.


#### EOSC-Nordic

[European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Nordic](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/) aims at bridging e-services in the Nordic
region with European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The Nordic Climate Community is
represented in EOSC-Nordic by a few partners of the NICEST project. NICEST-2
complements this unique climate science demonstrator by ensuring that:

- the EOSC-Nordic services are fully adopted by the Nordic community, 
- relevant training material is developed and introduced to researchers from different disciplines, 
- other use cases can also be easily deployed on EOSC-Nordic services following the same approach. 

## Success factors

The following success factors are the most important to NICEST-2:
- Access to experts on ESM and ESMValTool provided by the partners.
- Access to experts on FAIR data (EOSC-Nordic)
- Access to experts on containerization
- Access to e-infrastructures that enable collaborative work: [Galaxy Climate Workbench](https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/) and the [NIRD toolkit](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-toolkit).
- Access to HPC and cloud services with container enabled technologies (Docker, singularity, Sarus, rkt) and storage from national providers.
- Access to containers (private/public) and workflow (public) repositories

# Objective

## Project idea

Towards Open Science, NICEST-2 contributes to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of Earth System Models over the Nordic regions by optimizing ESM workflows, developing diagnostics specific to the Nordics and a clear roadmap for publishing Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) climate data.

## Project objective

NICEST-2 aims at 
- improving the e-infrastructure to tackle these challenges in optimal conditions, with minimal waste of resources, and
- setting up the building blocks for ESM workflows which are to be deployed as part of the Nordic European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), thereby realizing its full potential for the benefit of the Nordics.

## Priority of the objective

- **Result**:	0.6
- **Time**:	0.1
- **Cost**:     0.3

## Limitations

The infrastructures on EOSC-Nordic may not be available yet at the start of the project. So rather than having a single e-infrastructure for collaborating, we will be using separate e-infrastructures: HPCs on one side and on the other side the [Galaxy Climate Workbench](https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/) and the [NIRD toolkit](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-toolkit).
