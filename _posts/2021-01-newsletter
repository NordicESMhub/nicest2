## Running NorESM with containers

Reproducing ESM simulations is particularly hard but container technology
can help to ensure exactly the same computing environment everywhere from your
laptop to the most powerful HPC.

[NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM) can now be successfully run within a docker container:
- For mroe information check our [NorESM docker repository](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESMCAM_docker).

Since October 2020, [Singularity is now available on HPCs from Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/experimental-support-singuarlity-containers-all-sigma2-systems)
(Saga, Fram and Betzy), and our next challenge will be to develop portable containers to carry out tests with multiple nodes and assess the performance of containerized applications 
compared to "bare metal" (ran directly on the host).

More information is available on our[NICEST2 Work Package 4 webpage](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/nicest2/2020/05/04/plan.html#wp4-esm-workflows-to-efficiently-run-noresm-and-ec-earth-on-eurohpc).
