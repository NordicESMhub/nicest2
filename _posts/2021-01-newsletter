# Glossary for Nordic Climate
As part of the [NICEST2 project](https://neic.no/nicest2), we have started a list of definitions of commonly used [Climate Terms in the Nordic countries](). 

The aim is also to include the list of Nordic institutions working on Climate in the Nordics and data repositories commonly used for these studies.
