# Background and connections

## Background

Earth System Modeling research is essential to assess the drastic impacts of climate change and 
requires huge computing and storage resources that are still provided locally e.g. at national level.
This hinders bit-replicability and makes it difficult for researchers to compare their developments and confidently validate the scientific results. 
In addition, the cost and expertise necessary for developing and improving Earth System Models often lead researchers to join large international consortium that do not necessarily focus on the Nordic regions.
Most Nordic countries participate to initiatives such as [CMIP6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) and/or [CORDEX](https://cordex.org/) (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) but in a very little coordinated way.

The [EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/) initiative is a unique opportunity for the Nordic countries towards a coordinated effort for the Nordic participation to Climate Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP) provided that all the necessary building blocks (containerization, workflow management, job orchestration,
model diagnostics) for creating fully reproducible and efficient ESM workflows as well as for publishing FAIR climate data are in place.

### Expected benefits

- More ESM simulations done in less time through performance enhancements of the codes and optimization of the workflows for the entire community
- Homogeneous workflows for ESMs (NorESM, EC-Earth)
- Common diagnostic tools/workflows for highlighting climate impact in the Nordics
- Lower cost and better energy efficiency of the simulations
- Possibility to have a joint Nordic CMIP participation
- Benefit for all ESM researchers in the Nordic, not only those involved in CMIPs
- Climate data would be easier to access and exploit, even for non-specialists


## Connections with other organisations or projects

### Earth system modeling and CMIP

An important way to get ESMs internationally recognized is through the [World Climate
Research Program](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/) (WCRP) sponsored CMIPs which is a unique international initiative that
highlights the importance of sharing, comparing and analyzing the outcomes of global
climate model simulations and to deliver high quality climate information. [CMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip) results have
been used in a very large number of scientific studies that make them a cornerstone of [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/)
assessment reports. Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish modeling groups have
participated in phase 6 of CMIP (CMIP6).
The regional counterpart to CMIP is the [Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment](https://cordex.org/)
(CORDEX) endorsed by the WCRP that has produced a large ensemble of RCM
integrations at high horizontal resolution for all continents. The CORDEX results are now
being used worldwide for climate impact studies and climate change adaptation work.

### ENES and IS-ENES: The European Network for Earth System modeling

Several partners in this proposal are actively involved in the [ENES/IS-ENES](https://is.enes.org/) European
collaboration. ENES aims to 

- help in the development and evaluation of state-of-the-art climate and ESMs, 
- facilitate focused model intercomparisons in order to assess and improve them, 
- encourage exchanges of software and model results, iv) help in the development of high-performance computing facilities dedicated to long high-resolution, multi-model ensemble integrations.

The Climate Modelling community is an essential component of joint European efforts to
build a European framework of earth system modelling as part of the ENES/IS-ENES
network (European Network for Earth System Science), through Horizon 2020 projects (e.g.
[CRESCENDO](https://www.crescendoproject.eu/)), as well as Joint Programming Initiative and possibly 
[European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures](https://www.esfri.eu/) (ESFRI) instruments. 

### Infrastructure for Norwegian Earth System modelling (INES)

Norwegian partners of the NICEST-2 proposal are all engaged in the 
[Infrastructure for Norwegian Earth System modelling](https://noresmhub.github.io/INES/) (INES) project 
(funded by the Norwegian Research Council) that aims at establishing the next generation climate
model for Norwegian and Nordic research and at providing society and business with the
most recent high-quality knowledge base, at a time when climate change is understood and recognized as a primary driver for change in wide socio-economic areas of Norway.
The INES project is unique in Norway, serving climate-related user communities in a cost-efficient way, which will further enhance knowledge transfer to all researchers in the Nordics.

### The Nordics and NeIC

Within the Nordic ESM modeling community, there is significant and sustained support for
the concept of a Nordic collaboration. Several initiatives have been initiated in response to
this ongoing interest.

#### NordicESM

The NordForsk [NordicESM](https://nordicesm.bitbucket.io/) project investigated the potential modes and merits
of a coordinated/integrated Nordic platform and collaboration for earth system modeling. The project ended in November 2017.

#### NICEST

The objective of the [NICEST](https://neic.no/nicest/) project was to strengthen the Nordic ESM community by
supporting the efficient use of various e-infrastructures through competence building, sharing
and exchanging knowledge. The project ended in december 2019.


#### EOSC-Nordic

[European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Nordic](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/) aims at bridging e-services in the Nordic
region with European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The Nordic Climate Community is
represented in EOSC-Nordic by a few partners of the NICEST project. NICEST-2
complements this unique climate science demonstrator by ensuring that:

- the EOSC-Nordic services are fully adopted by the Nordic community, 
- relevant training material is developed and introduced to researchers from different disciplines, 
- other use cases can also be easily deployed on EOSC-Nordic services following the same approach. 

## Success factors

The following success factors are the most important to NICEST-2:
- Access to experts on ESM and ESMValTool provided by the partners.
- Access to experts on FAIR data (EOSC-Nordic)
- Access to experts on containerization
- Access to e-infrastructures that enable collaborative work: [Galaxy Climate Workbench](https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/) and the [NIRD toolkit](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-toolkit).
- Access to HPC and cloud services with container enabled technologies (Docker, singularity, Sarus, rkt) and storage from national providers.
- Access to containers (private/public) and workflow (public) repositories

# Objective

## Project idea

Towards Open Science, NICEST-2 contributes to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of Earth System Models over the Nordic regions by optimizing ESM workflows, developing diagnostics specific to the Nordics and a clear roadmap for publishing Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) climate data.

## Project objective

NICEST-2 aims at 
- improving the e-infrastructure to tackle these challenges in optimal conditions, with minimal waste of resources, and
- setting up the building blocks for ESM workflows which are to be deployed as part of the Nordic European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), thereby realizing its full potential for the benefit of the Nordics.

Contributions are given in Person months (PMs).

|-------------------------|---------|------------------|--------|

##### **Objectives** 

The main objective of this activity is to define a clear roadmap to FAIR climate modeling data
in the Nordics. This activity will be strongly linked to EOSC-Nordic, in particular WP4 "FAIR
data" and WP5 "Open Research demonstrators". 

##### **Description of work**

Two main tasks have been identified:

- Task 3.1 (NSC, CSC, NORCE): Support for Nordic ESGF hosting of CMIP6 data
(M1-M36)
Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish HPC providers currently host ESGF nodes.
Although there have been considerable improvements in the ESGF software, the
deployment and reliable maintenance of an ESGF node requires experience and a
technical understanding of the hardware and ESGF software. In addition, knowledge
of climate model output formats, project data reference syntax and controlled
vocabularies (e.g.CMIP6) is also required. This activity will continue to strengthen the
collaborative efforts, knowledge sharing and skills development initiated in the
NICEST project regarding the deployment and administration of ESGF nodes.
- Task 3.2 (NSC, NORCE, MetNo) : Towards FAIR Nordic climate modeling data
Beyond CMIP6 and CORDEX, there are Nordic and national projects that generate
valuable climate model data. The management of these outputs should follow FAIR 
and open data principles. The aim of this sub-activity is to investigate to what extent
the tools (including ES-DOC, CF, CMOR, ESGF) and techniques for managing
CMIP6 data can be reused in Nordic and national projects to ensure the valuable
outputs from such projects are FAIR and open. This will be achieved by bringing
together data generators (ESM modelers), data managers (ESGF) and FAIR data
specialists (M4-M15 and M31-M36).

##### **Deliverables**
- *D3.1*:  Online minutes from all Nordic ESGF operation meetings (e.g., one per
month for all the duration of the project)
- *D3.2*: 1 face to face workshop for Nordic ESGF operations team on the ESGF
CMIP6 publication process.
- *D3.3*: 1 hackathon with FAIR experts and ESM specialists to understand what
needs to be done for making Climate data FAIR (for NorESM and EC-Earth).
- *D3.4*: Report on knowledge/skills gap analysis and suggested roadmap to FAIR
Nordic climate modeling data
- *D3.5*: 1 Data Management Plan Template, including best practices for FAIR Nordic
Climate Data
- *D3.6*: 1 Data stewardship workshop for FAIR climate data

### WP4: ESM workflows to efficiently run NorESM and EC-Earth on euroHPC

|-------------------------|---------|------------------|--------|
| Work package number     | 4       | Lead institution |  UiO   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|Work package short title |	Integrated workflows for ESMs   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Participants		  | UiO, NERSC, NORCE, DMI, FMI         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| PMs per participant	  |                                     |		
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Start month	          | 2020-09 | End month	       |2023-05 |
|-------------------------|---------|------------------|--------|

##### **Objectives** 

The main objective of this activity is to develop expertise on how to run efficiently ESM
workflows and facilitate the porting and deployment of Nordic ESMs on future HPCs, in
particular the EuroHPC. 

##### **Description of work**

Two main tasks have been identified:

- Task 4.1 (UiO, NORCE, NERSC, FMI): Reproducible workflows for deploying and
 running ESM on future HPCs (M4-M9 and M25-M30)
 As part of this task an analysis of existing workflow Management systems (cylc, galaxy,
 snakemake, etc.) will be done and will be the basis for the definition of Nordic ESM workflow
 Management Systems. Mock-up ESM workflows will be made available by mid-term and will
 facilitate benchmarking of Nordic ESMs on new HPCs and ease the deployment of Nordic
 ESMs on EuroHPCs. To improve reproducibility, package management system and
 environment management system such as conda will be tested, and containers for running
 these models will be deployed. The performance achieved by the containerized models will
 be made publicly available.
 Within High Energy Physics (e.g., CERN LHC), many solutions and services do already exist
 to tackle complex tasks like workflow management execution with data and compute. Those
 solutions are being used now by more and more scientific communities. One potential idea is
 to identify some use cases and evaluate the services available like job management, data
 catalog and orchestration. A demonstrator will be set up as part of the project with technical
 support and expertise from NORDIC WLCG TIER-1 FACILITY.
- Task 4.2  (NORCE, UiO, FMI): Efficiency of Nordic ESMs on future euroHPC (M13-M24 and M34-M36)
Having a common framework to analyze the performance of Nordic ESMs can considerably
reduce the cost (computing and energy efficiency) for running climate models and give us a
competitive advantage for running on the future computing platforms, including EuroHPC.
This task will focus on best practices for performance and productivity of Nordic ESMs and
on understanding what we need to do to be able to run on EuroHPC.

##### **Deliverables**
- *D4.1*: 1 deliverable/report on the identification of the Nordic ESM community needs for
ESM workflows (analysis of existing tools such as cylc, galaxy, snakemake) and
identification/classification of associated services to be deployed for efficiently orchestrating
these workflows on various computing platforms.
- *D4.2*: 1 demonstrator build with a simple use case for distributing computations and
managing data on at least 3 different sites (within the Nordic countries). The associated
deliverable will be publicly available.
- *D4.3*: 1 online training material on best practices for the deployment of ESM workflows
(package management, writing efficient workflows to optimize computing and storage
resources)
- *D4.4*: 1 workshop (face to face meeting) with national HPC providers to discuss and
characterize the nordic ESM involvement in EuroHPC
- *D4.5*: 1 deliverable/report on bottlenecks that would hindrance the efficient usage of
Nordic ESMs on EuroHPC and possible remediation actions (I/Os, adding GPU support,
etc.) with a clear information on costs (PMs, etc.)
- *D4.6*: Best practice guides on how to evaluate the performance of Nordic ESMs.

## Gantt chart

<img src="/nicest2/img/posts/gantt.png" width="600"/>

## Priority of the objective

- **Result**:	0.6
- **Time**:	0.1
- **Cost**:     0.3

## Limitations

The infrastructures on EOSC-Nordic may not be available yet at the start of the project. So rather than having a single e-infrastructure for collaborating, we will be using separate e-infrastructures: HPCs on one side and on the other side the [Galaxy Climate Workbench](https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/) and the [NIRD toolkit](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-toolkit).

HPC/cloud computing and storage are offered for the duration of the project by the national e-infrastructure bodies and participating partners.

## Purchases

- Subscription for a container repository for ESM (with both the possibility to have private and public containers)


# Organisation

## Project organisation

The project is organised according the PPS project method with the following groups or roles:

- **Steering group**: Michaela Barth (*chair*), Anne Claire Fouilloux (*secretary*), Alok Kumar Gupta, Hamish Struthers, Risto Makkonen.
- **Project owner**: Michaela Barth
- **Project leader**: Anne Claire Fouilloux

The consortium members are listed on the [NeIC NICEST-2 website](https://neic.no/nicest2/).

The major decisions in the project are made by the Steering group. The Steering group accepts the Project plan, approves deliveries, and decides on transferral of responsibility of the project results. The Steering group has also possibility to modify the project plan if needed.

Practical level project follow-up is done by the Project owner, who is also the chair of the steering group. The Project owner will oversee that the project works towards the project idea and project objective.

The Project manager is responsible for day to day management of the project and of leading the project group. The Project manager also prepares the project plan. The Project manager makes proposals to the Steering group on decision points, such as acceptance of deliveries, change requests or any running business that needs to be decided. Project manager acts as a secretary in the Steering group meetings.

The Project members group is formed by the experts provided by the partners.


# Working methods

The Tieto Practical Project Steering (PPS) model is applied with certain adaptations within NeIC with good practical experience since 2014.
The [NeIC HR policy](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/NeIC_HR_Policy) applies encouraging competence development and regular development dialogues. The NICEST-2 project manager is part of the community of project managers and project owner representatives with regular (bi-weekly) meetings and three F2F meetings per year, the annual NeIC All Hands meeting and biannual NeIC conferences. The management meetings between the project manager and the project owner representative are scheduled weekly. The team meetings are held regularly over an agreed-on communication platform.

## Requirement dialogue	

The requirements from a higher level come from the project directive drawn by Steering group members and NeIC. The participating experts will take the requirements to a more technical level, and there will be regular discussions at project and Steering Group meetings. 

##  Change control

Change requests, for example from the project community, or from NeIC that are seen to
necessitate a significant change in the project requirements are documented in writing. The decision on approval of change requests will be made by the project manager with consultation to the project owner or in a case of major change will be taken to the steering group for decision. Small changes can be accommodated within the normal development cycle of the project.

The project will follow the schedule of the project and if a significant factor affecting the project
emerges, there can be a decision to re-prioritize the requirements accordingly. This re-prioritization may be proposed by any member of the project and at least agreed by the project manager and owner. The steering group is not needed in such cases.


##  Risk management

WP1 is in charge of minimizing the potential risk of misalignments and ensure that the developments provide full and easy re-use tools for the entire ESM community. The evolving needs of the active ESM research community will be regularly monitored.
Communication with national HPC providers to ensure alignement with future EuroHPC platforms, in particular LUMI.


## Information distribution

The project aims for open and transparent communications. The main hub for communications is the 
[NICEST-2 project website](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/nicest2/), including NeIC wiki pages (internal and public).

Other channels include Zoom and email.

The regular meetings of the project include:
- **Steering group meetings**:  at decision points 
- **Project management meetings**: every week

## Document management

Documents produced in the project will be put either in the [NICEST-2 project website](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/nicest2/), the internal wiki or public wiki pages. 

All documents that potentially have interest outside the immediate project group should be placed on 
[NICEST-2 project website](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/nicest2/) and can also be referenced in [Nordic Earth System Modelling Hub website]((https://nordicesmhub.github.io), if there is no specific reason to not publish them. The internal wiki is mainly for documents in preparation or for meeting notes etc. that are not of general interest (e.g. working group meetings, project management meetings).
Some documents will be prepared on Google Drive before publication. 

## Confidentiality

The project aims at open communication in its execution. However, before publishing information consideration is required whether there is particular reasons for this information not to be public. If in doubt, it is good practice to ask the author of the document in question, the project leader, or the funders of the project, whichever is applicable. The Steering group can make the final decision on withdrawing project documents from public access.

Special care should be taken when working on and creating products using climate data (models, observations) as they may contain personal information and/or sensitive information.

## Environment

One of the objective of the project is to optimize ESM workflows both in terms of performance and energy efficiency. 
The project will take a particular attention to this matter and make sure to avoid unecessary travels.
We will organize most meeting online (including trainings) instead of physical meetings consequently reducing air travel.

## Administrative routines

Service contracts will be made for persons working in the project. The contract will be made between the employing organization and NeIC. The service contract specifies the amount of working time committed for the project. Formally the project leader decides on nominating persons to work for the project.

The project personnel should follow the practices of their home organization for time reporting. The iOBS project does not require time reports. Instead, the results will be closely followed.

NeIC will cover costs for travel which is necessary for the project work. Covering the travel costs need to be agreed beforehand with the project leader.

# Risks

### List of risks and associated mitigation actions

*TODO*: list of risks, probability of occurence and associated mitigation actions.

The list of risks will be continuously updated as well as corresponding mitigation actions. 

Any risks that materialize during the lifetime of the project will be documented in the Risk register.
Risks that have a major impact on the project results will be immediately reported to the NICEST-2 project owner and mitigation actions will be closely monitored.
