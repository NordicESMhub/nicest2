## Project Plan

The first draft of the [NICEST2 Project Plan](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/nicest2/2020/05/04/plan.html) has been recently published. It will be regularly updated before the start of the project (June 2020).

# NICEST2 expected benefits

*Strengthen the Nordic position within climate modeling by leveraging, reinforcing and complementing ongoing initiatives to enable a future joint Nordic Climate Model Intercomparison Project and Nordic Climate-as-a-service.
*

- Enhance the performance and optimize and homogenize workflows used, so climate models (like EC-EARTH and NorESM) can be run in an efficient way on future computing resources (like EuroHPC).
- Widen the usage and expertise on evaluating Earth System Models and develop new diagnostic modules for the Nordic region within the ESMValTool
- Create a roadmap for FAIRification of Nordic climate model data
