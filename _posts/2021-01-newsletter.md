# Glossary for Nordic Climate

As part of the [NICEST2 project](https://neic.no/nicest2), we have started a list of definitions of commonly used [Climate Terms in the Nordic countries](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/nordic-climate-glossary/). 

The aim is also to include the list of Nordic institutions working on Climate in the Nordics and data repositories commonly used for these studies. 

See our [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](https://github.com/NordicESMhub/nordic-climate-glossary/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for adding your institutions, data repository, etc.
