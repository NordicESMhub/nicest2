## Glossary for Nordic Climate

As part of the [NICEST2 project](https://neic.no/nicest2), we have started a list of definitions of commonly used [Climate Terms in the Nordic countries](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/nordic-climate-glossary/). 

The aim is also to include:
- the list of Nordic institutions working on Climate in the Nordics
- data repositories commonly used for Climate studies. 

See our [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](https://github.com/NordicESMhub/nordic-climate-glossary/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for adding your institutions, data repository, etc.

## ESM diagnostic expert group

- Are you working in a Nordic/Baltic country and
- Are you using ESMValTool and
- Do you consider yourself as an expert on ESM diagnostics?

We would love to hear from you! We aim at creating an ESM diagnostic expert group to:
- collaborate on the development of ESM diagnostics for the Nordic countries
- get access to bespoke resources from EOSC-Nordic to collaboratively work on the development of new ESM diagnostics for the Nordics
- join our annual ESM diagnostic online event to show and hear about the latest developments for the Nordic researchers

Please contact the NICEST2 project Manager (annefou-at-geo.uio.no).

## Support mailing list for ESGF node administrators in the Nordic

To facilitate exchange of knowledge and provide support to ESGF node administrators,
a new mailing list has been created. If you are an ESGF node administrator in a Nordic/Baltic country
and did not receive any email about it, contact the NICEST2 Project Manager (annefou-at-geo.uio.no).

## Running NorESM with containers

Reproducing ESM simulations is particularly hard but container technology
can help to ensure exactly the same computing environment everywhere from your
laptop to the most powerful HPC.

Thanks to the collaborative work between [INES](https://www.ines.noresm.org/) and [NICEST2](https://neic.no/nicest2/), [NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM) can now be successfully run within a docker container:
- For more information check the [NorESM docker github repository](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESMCAM_docker).

Within NICEST2, further work will be done to run NorESM & EC-EARTH with different container engines such as [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/), [rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/) and [Sarus](https://sarus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Our goal is to be able to use containers with different Workflow Management Systems.

Since October 2020, [Singularity is now available on HPCs from Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/experimental-support-singuarlity-containers-all-sigma2-systems)
(Saga, Fram and Betzy), and our next challenge will be to develop portable containers to carry out tests with multiple nodes and assess the performance of containerized applications 
compared to "bare metal" (ran directly on the host).

Within NICEST2, we are particularly interested in offering a simple framework for running efficiently ESMs in containers.

More information is available on our [NICEST2 Work Package 4 webpage](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/nicest2/2020/05/04/plan.html#wp4-esm-workflows-to-efficiently-run-noresm-and-ec-earth-on-eurohpc).

## Workshops & other events

### NICEST2 events: save the dates

#### Hackathon on FAIR Climate Data

The NICEST2 project is organizing an hackathon on FAIR Climate data.
We plan to offer both training and hands-on and will be using the 
[EOSC-Nordic JupyterLab](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-service-platform) deployed with the [NIRD Service Platform](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-service-platform).

##### Draft program

- Thursday 11 Mar, afternoon. Training, FAIR ontology, verification of FAIRness (FAIR score). Describe CMOR, CF-4, ES-DOC, ESGF.
- Tuesday 16 Mar, afternoon. Hands on.
- Wednesday 17 Mar, afternoon. Hands on.


#### Hackathon on ESMValTool for users

An hackathon on ESM diagnostic tools (ESMValTool) will be organized in March as a one day event.

- Possible dates: 9-12+18+19 / 23+24  March 2021

More information will be posted very soon on the [NordicESMHub event page](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/events).

### Events from partners

- [NordicESMHub event page](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/events): list of up to date information on all our events and events from our partners.
- [IS-ENES events](https://is.enes.org/events): IS-ENES offers events for the Earthâ€™s climate system modelling community.
- [Copernicus Climate Change Service event page](https://climate.copernicus.eu/events): C3S organises a range of events to learn how to use Copernicus Climate data and associated online services. They also advertise numerous events organised by other organisations. 
- [EOSC-Nordic event page](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/events/): upcoming and past events with lots of information about Open Science and Cliate Science demonstrators.
- [CodeRefinery workshops/events](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/): CodeRefinery workshops aim grow researchers' software best practices skills and to consolidate knowledge learnt during Carpentries workshops or from prior experience. The focus is on professional tools for efficiently developing and maintaining research software.
